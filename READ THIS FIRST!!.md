TileEntity-EXAMPLE
==================

This is how I render a Techne model as a block,
I'm, still learning and I can't find a place to upload the textures on here so you'll have to use your own model or make a texture. :)
Could use some help with them all facing the same direction, it's driving me nuts!....I cant figure it out and no one will help lol
So if you know how and would like to help me please  contact xgravebornx on the minecraft forums! Thanks and enjoy!
